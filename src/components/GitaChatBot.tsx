This means:
‚Ä¢ Perform your duties without attachment to results
‚Ä¢ Act with dedication but without ego

True detachment means:
‚Ä¢ Acting without being bound by outcomes

**Key practices:**
‚Ä¢ Regular meditation to still the mind
‚Ä¢ Pranayama (breath control)
‚Ä¢ Concentration on the Divine
‚Ä¢ Cultivating inner stillness

‚Ä¢ Offering all actions to Krishna
‚Ä¢ Accepting whatever comes as Divine will

‚Ä¢ Practice surrendering outcomes to the Divine
‚Ä¢ Focus on your duty without attachment to results
‚Ä¢ Cultivate equanimity in success and failure

"When a man thinks of objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises." (2.62)

‚Ä¢ Purifying your consciousness through righteous action
‚Ä¢ Ultimately returning to your spiritual home

‚Ä¢ It arises from attachment to temporary things
‚Ä¢ It's often a teacher, guiding us toward wisdom
‚Ä¢ The eternal soul cannot actually be harmed
‚Ä¢ Difficulties test and strengthen our spiritual resolve

"The material miseries derive from the senses. O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them." (5.22)

‚Ä¢ See your work as service to the Divine
‚Ä¢ Perform duties without attachment to salary or recognition
‚Ä¢ Maintain integrity and compassion in all dealings
‚Ä¢ Use your skills to serve others

"Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues." (3.21)

**Spiritual relationships involve:**
‚Ä¢ Seeing the Divine in every person
‚Ä¢ Loving without possessiveness or control
‚Ä¢ Supporting others' spiritual growth
‚Ä¢ Practicing forgiveness and compassion

"One who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me never becomes lost to Me, nor do I become lost to him." (6.30)

**Understanding death:**
‚Ä¢ Only the body dies; the soul is eternal
‚Ä¢ Death is like changing clothes - the soul takes a new body
‚Ä¢ Your consciousness at death determines your next life
‚Ä¢ Regular spiritual practice prepares you for a peaceful transition

"And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt." (8.5)
